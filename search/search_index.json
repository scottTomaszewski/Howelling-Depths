At daybreak of a new Spring day, seven unlikely individuals gathered in the [[Twisted Thicket Tavern]] after being summoned by Stron Oxglove , Captain of the Tiselles Guard. As our adventurers met for the first time, beers and breakfast were ordered just before a disagrement broken out as tensions rose. Before things escalated beyond control, Stron and Haldir Stoutlock entered the Tavern, pacified the situaton, and called the Adventurers to a table where he informs the group that the City Guard was in need of some assistance in dealing with a local Goblin Clan stealing from the local residents. After recruiting the adventuers to the cause, Stron and Haldir departed the tavern as you overhear them discussing what sounds like battle plans and the adventuers followed shortly. Within the Village market, the party was immediately drawn to Quentin Baggybottoms who was ecstatic to talk about [[Arcana Wyrm]]s and offered some Healing Kits as a token of appreciation, especially for the inquisitive queries about the mating rituals of the Wyrms. The adventurers made their way to the Tiselles Gate where they met the brash mason Brobouck Hammerchest , who mentors Perrinn Ophinstalajiir and reminded Perrinn to run an errand for Ms. Lavern tomorrow. At the Gate entrance, the adventurers met their guide, Flynn Thorncoat who called the group a \"bunch of misfits\" under his breath and recieved an axe to the foot in turn. Introductions were made, Toothless gathered some notes, and and the group set out in the lush wilderness known as the High Forest where they appreciated the beauty of the vast nature surrounding them. A fox was hunted, suspicious mushrooms were seen, and small talk was made as they made their way east down the well-worn road. Several hours in, Flynn led the adventurers off the main path and onto a smaller trail. It wasn't long before the Scout made a wrong turn, but was quickly corrected by the keen survival instincts of Grendyl Silverbuck . Before moving on, Grendyl threatened Flynn by throwing a knife between his legs, and Ulfgar body-checked Flynn to the ground. Flynn brushed it off and led onwards. Before arriving at their destination, the adventurers passed a fallen silk cocoon, the remnant of a Giant Spider's meal and a reminder that they are not alone in this forest. The group finally arrived at the entrance of the Goblin Lair where a patrol of Goblins got the jump on our adventurers in a surprise flurry of arrows. Our protagonists take several arrows to their bodies, a battle ensues, and by the end of it, the clearing was littered with corpses.

Elrondhel in the base of a tree to keep watch on the gates, Nokomis and Magy in a room in the inn, Grendyl with his girlfriend Naivara Nailo , and Ulfgar as his residence 2 miles out of town. Perrinn and Toothless , however, went West to share a smoke in the evening. On their way they ran into Brobouck Hammerchest who was initially frustrated with Perry for missing his chores, but became nostalgic after tasting goblin blood. Sacks of stones were dumped onto Perrinn and Toothless as Brobouck retold the story of loosing his eye to a Goblin's \"toothpick\" of a sword. Brobouck went inside is home while Perrinn and Toothless walked to the water's edge and lit their pipes. As smoke swirled around Perrinn 's head, they formed some of his most impressive accomplishments beginning with winning a tic tac toe game against his mom as a young dragonborn and the his first time breathing toxins with his father. The next memory revealed to Toothless the truth of what happened on the day Perrinn \"saved\" the mayor; the smoke showed Perrinn took no action, but the mayor ignorantly praised Perrinn as a hero. Finally, the smoke showed one last memory: the lifeless body of Toothless lay on the ground and Dragonborn hands reach out, glow, and breath returns to the corpse once more. Toothless departed for the evening and Perrinn met Brobouck inside where Brobouck led the Dragonborn to a room never seen before. Inside held trinkets and adventuring equipment used by Brobouck many years ago. Brobouck helped the young bard to augment his drum with the ability to create illusions. Declaring its time to sleep, the Dwarf touched his Lyre, created a powder, threw it into the air, and forced the two of you to fall into a deep slumber. When you all awoke in the morning, a renewed and newfound strength swelled within you as you gained a level. Rejoining in the tavern over breakfast and coffee, you decided to split the group to attend to some errands for the day. Elrondhel , Nokomis , and Toothless made their way to the Mage Tower to seek out clarification on their findings in the depths of the Goblin Lair. After describing their findings, Layla Mooncoat was able to determine that the figure was casting Teleportation Circle, a spell that requires a powerful caster. She was confused that a magic-user of such power was unable to kill off the group of adventurers... unless Axton was stealing the arcane energy of the Arcana Wyrms. This thought triggered a memory of an expelled student who attended the Conclave of Silverymoon at the same time as her. The student, Onazar, was expelled from the school by the Conclave Council for \"illegal experimentation on Awakened Shrubs\", but a punishment of that severity was abnormal for a rule so commonly broken at the Conclave. Rumor has it that the Council felt Onazar's research was a personal threat and dealt with it swiftly. If indeed, the actions of Axton were related to Onazar's research, then this would certainly be something to be concerned about, as they would be seeking out sources of energy. Meanwhile, Magy made her way to the Town Records building in search of her Father. After 6 hours of diligent investigation, Magy found an entry in the Manifest that resembled her own face - a dwarf named Silgrul Orothiar who arrived in Tiselles 10 years prior and disappeared 2 years later during a \"research trip\" to the Northeast. Along with the entry was something of a trinket left behind. During these conversations, Ulfgar enters into town, watched by the guards in the gate towers, as he makes his way over to Steely Steals - the Blacksmith's shopfront. While negotiating the repair of his Greataxe with Ium Steelglade , Ium's crazed Father, Ursus Steelglade entered the tent and offered to enchant the Greataxe with the power to \"whisper\". After agreeing on the transaction, the excitement provoked a mane to burst from Ursus' neck and he explained it was a result of past enchanting mishaps. Grendyl and Perrinn spent this time to seek clarity in the City Watch's recent dealings. To their surprise, they met a formally-dressed and acceptably-groomed Haldir who informed them that Stron Oxglove was killed during the time the party was in the Goblin Lair while attempting to deal with man-eating plants. Perrinn offered gold and his condolences, but Haldir respectfully declined.

Rumor has it that the Council felt Onazar's research was a personal threat and dealt with it swiftly. If indeed, the actions of Axton were related to Onazar's research, then this would certainly be something to be concerned about, as they would be seeking out sources of energy. Meanwhile, Magy made her way to the Town Records building in search of her Father. After 6 hours of diligent investigation, Magy found an entry in the Manifest that resembled her own face - a dwarf named Silgrul Orothiar who arrived in Tiselles 10 years prior and disappeared 2 years later during a \"research trip\" to the Northeast. Along with the entry was something of a trinket left behind. During these conversations, Ulfgar enters into town, watched by the guards in the gate towers, as he makes his way over to Steely Steals - the Blacksmith's shopfront. While negotiating the repair of his Greataxe with Ium Steelglade , Ium's crazed Father, Ursus Steelglade entered the tent and offered to enchant the Greataxe with the power to \"whisper\". After agreeing on the transaction, the excitement provoked a mane to burst from Ursus' neck and he explained it was a result of past enchanting mishaps. Grendyl and Perrinn spent this time to seek clarity in the City Watch's recent dealings. To their surprise, they met a formally-dressed and acceptably-groomed Haldir who informed them that Stron Oxglove was killed during the time the party was in the Goblin Lair while attempting to deal with man-eating plants. Perrinn offered gold and his condolences, but Haldir respectfully declined.","title":"Session Recap"},{"location":"Sessions/Session%205%20-%20Curious%20in%20Tiselles/#buffs","text":"Grendyl and Perrinn have DM Inspiration for role playing","title":"Buffs"},{"location":"Sessions/Session%206%20-%20The%20sheep%2C%20in%20deep%2C%20and%20weep/","text":"Session 6 - The sheep, in deep, and weep \u00b6 Session Recap \u00b6 Last we left off, Layla Mooncoat had a spark of an idea and quickly requested you all return to the Mage Tower at midnight.

The moment of solidarity was soon interrupted by the voice of Haldir , the new Captain of the Guard.

Grendyl pulled Haldir aside and offered to help, then sought out his girlfriend Naivara Nailo for information before heading out to the sheep pasture for recon with Perrinn . Finding little except a destroyed fence, blood smears, and Frankfurt the Sheep , the two headed back to town to gather the others. After Ulfgar borrowed a lance for the remainder of the day, The Stron Seven headed out to the sheep pasture once again and investigated the area to find... absolutely nothing. No animals, no movement. Just stillness as the blood of fallen guards stained the grass. On the way back to the town, your ears were filled with the sounds of screams and panic. Naivara crouched in fear at the edge of the pasture as you ran into Tiselles to find Brobouck held by invisible chains, helpless against the figure before him.

Point made, Onazar gave his introduction: he was a man of higher purpose and and he was not one to tolerate interruptions to progress from insignificant sluggards. In his departure, attempts to slow or impede him were refuted quickly and absolutely. Onazar responded to El's attack with a spike to her mind that brought her to unconsciousness immediately. He left the Stron Seven wounded, grieving, emotional, frustrated. As you all took in the situation, you found that any man or woman who crossed Onazar's path during his arrival was left withered - their very essence siphoned away from them. Brobouck's corpse was brought back to his home, and Perrinn noticed a pulsing ring on the door to Brobouck's secure back room. Repeating the pattern she witnessed the night before, the door attuned to her and gave her entry. Meanwhile, the others made their way to Layla's Mage Tower and found her wounded in the streets.
