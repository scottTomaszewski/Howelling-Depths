## Setting 

> Our adventurers will begin on the continent of **FaerÃ»n** in a region known as **The High Forest** - a holdover from the early days of the world, when elves, giants, and dragons ruled a continent covered in green.  It is a home to all woodland races, but is too large for any one group to rule completely. At present, the greatest powers within the forest are the treants, the wood elves, and the centaurs.  Although there are numerous settlements throughtout, what lies within the deep forest is somewhat of a mystery, and few have explored its depths.  What we do know is the forest is home to mountains, rivers, and woodlands of all varieties; some of which are said to have an arcane energy about them...
>
> Within The High Forest in a subregion called **Deepwood**, the group gathers in a settlement called **[[Tiselles]]** - A small, primarily human settlement on the banks of the **Heartblood River**.  The forest edge is 60 miles down river to the southeast and can be reached by boat or path.  To the west, the river continues towards the ancient city of **Karse**. To the north lies the heart of Deepwood, a place where the forest grows thick and remains largely untouched.

The year is 1496 and the adventurers meet in the Spring.
