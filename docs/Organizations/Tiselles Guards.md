# Tiselles Guards

The group on guards that protect [[Tiselles]].  Previously led by Captain [[Stron Oxglove]], but now led by [[Haldir Stoutlock]] after Stron was killed attempting to resolved a threat on the local sheep. In their first meeting, Stron expressed that the City Watch personnel resources were thin at the moment and needed assistance dealing with some thefts.  This resource limitation is now further exacerbated by the loss of guards to the man-eating plants.

[[Flynn Thorncoat]] leads the scouts, responsible for dealing with issues and reconnaissance outside the settlement walls.
