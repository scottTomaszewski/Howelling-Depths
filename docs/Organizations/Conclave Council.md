# Conclave Council

The group of Headmasters at the Conclave of Silverymoon school.  Each Headmaster is responsible for an individual School of Magic. 

According to [[Layla Mooncoat]], this Council voted to expel [[Onazar]] for illegal experimentation on Awakened Shrubs, a punishment that seems excessive.
