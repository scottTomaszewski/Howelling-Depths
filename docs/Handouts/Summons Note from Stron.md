# Summons Note from Stron

Each of you receive the following note. For those that live in/near Tiselles, it is delivered by mail. For everyone else, a courier finds you while you're in the village.

> I ask a favor of you as I am in need of some assistance - your skill-set should prove useful. Meet me and Lieutenant Haldir at the [[Twisted Thicket Tavern]] tomorrow morning an hour after sunrise. And keep this between us.
