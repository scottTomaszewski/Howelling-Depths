# Town Manifest - Silgrul Orothiar

There is a low-quality image of a man, about 350 years old, 47 years older than [[Magy Merryflayer|Magy]]). The dwarf in the image has a face that bears the same features as [[Magy Merryflayer|Magy]]; the resemblance is uncanny.

```
- Arrived on a ship via the heartblood river, 1986 (10 years ago)
- Purpose: research
- Stayed in tiselles for ~2 years
- Departure: Disappeared one day. There was a small investigation
    - He left for a research trip, never returned
    - Headed north east
    - His personal affects were sold a year later except bin
- See bin 672
```

Within bin `672`, [[Magy Merryflayer|Magy]] found something of a symbol, made of metal.  Its properties are unknown
