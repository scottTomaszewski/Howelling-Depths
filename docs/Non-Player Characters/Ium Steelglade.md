# Ium Steelglade

![[Ium Steelglade.png|500]]

Resident Blacksmith within [[Tiselles]] and son of [[Ursus Steelglade]].  Doesn't seem to have much desire to converse.  When Ulgfar was getting his Greataxe repaired, he saw Ium reach his hand into the forge and was unaffected.  Ium's hand glowed red and Ursus took credit for the enchantment on his son.
