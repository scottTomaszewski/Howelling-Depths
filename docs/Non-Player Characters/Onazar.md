# Onazar

Individual that attended Conclave of Silverymoon along with [[Layla Mooncoat]] sbout 6 years prior (1490).  Described as a male of blue skin.  Was apparently expelled from the school for illegal experimentation on Awakened Shrubs in an effort to siphon arcane energy from them.  Expulsion for this behavior seemed excessive. Rumor is that the Headmasters of the school, known as the [[Conclave Council]], may have felt threatened if Onazar's research was developed, but this has never been confirmed.

[[Layla Mooncoat]] postulated that the events described in the Goblin Lair seem to be in the same vein as what Onazar was researching.  The figure killed by the party did not match the description of Onazar.
