# Session 6 - The sheep, in deep, and weep

## Session Recap

Last we left off, [[Layla Mooncoat]] had a spark of an idea and quickly requested you all return to the Mage Tower at midnight.  Before leaving, [[Toothless]] was presented with glyphs representing each of the known Schools of Magic.  He then chose to dedicate his study to Evocation and the mastery of elemental effects.

The party reconvened in the tavern and after some deliberation, you named yourselves _The Stron Seven_.

The moment of solidarity was soon interrupted by the voice of [[Haldir Stoutlock|Haldir]], the new Captain of the Guard. Gathering the town in the market, he announced the death of [[Stron Oxglove|Stron]] and that the threat to the sheep pasture remains while requesting aid from anyone willing.  He also mentioned that the balance of the forest should begin to normalize thanks to the Stron Seven.

[[Grendyl Silverbuck|Grendyl]] pulled [[Haldir Stoutlock|Haldir]] aside and offered to help, then sought out his girlfriend [[Naivara Nailo]] for information before heading out to the sheep pasture for recon with [[Perrinn Ophinstalajiir|Perrinn]].  Finding little except a destroyed fence, blood smears, and [[Frankfurt the Sheep]], the two headed back to town to gather the others.

After [[Ulfgar Frostbeard|Ulfgar]] borrowed a lance for the remainder of the day, The Stron Seven headed out to the sheep pasture once again and investigated the area to find... absolutely nothing.  No animals, no movement.  Just stillness as the blood of fallen guards stained the grass.

On the way back to the town, your ears were filled with the sounds of screams and panic.  [[Naivara Nailo|Naivara]] crouched in fear at the edge of the pasture as you ran into [[Tiselles]] to find [[Brobouck Hammerchest|Brobouck]] held by invisible chains, helpless against the figure before him.  The tall [[Onazar|man]] with blue skin, a shunted nose, and an arcane electricity arcing across his body cast a spell and the dwarf collapsed, lifeless.

Point made, [[Onazar]] gave his introduction: he was a man of higher purpose and and he was not one to tolerate interruptions to progress from insignificant sluggards.

In his departure, attempts to slow or impede him were refuted quickly and absolutely.  [[Onazar]] responded to [[Elrondhel Grayire|El's]] attack with a spike to her mind that brought her to unconsciousness immediately.

He left the Stron Seven wounded, grieving, emotional, frustrated.

As you all took in the situation, you found that any man or woman who crossed Onazar's path during his arrival was left withered - their very essence siphoned away from them.  

[[Brobouck Hammerchest|Brobouck's]] corpse was brought back to his home, and [[Perrinn Ophinstalajiir|Perrinn]] noticed a pulsing ring on the door to Brobouck's secure back room.  Repeating the pattern she witnessed the night before, the door attuned to her and gave her entry. 

Meanwhile, the others made their way to [[Layla Mooncoat|Layla's]] Mage Tower and found her wounded in the streets.
