# Session 1 - An Adventure Begins

## Summary

> Our adventure began near the center of the [[High Forest]] in [[Tiselles]], a Human Settlement on the banks of the Heartblood River.
> 
> At daybreak of a new Spring day, seven unlikely individuals gathered in the Twisted Thicket Tavern after being summoned by [[Stron Oxglove]], Captain of the Tiselles Guard.  As our adventurers met for the first time, beers and breakfast were ordered just before a disagrement broken out as tensions rose.  Before things escalated beyond control, Stron and [[Haldir Stoutlock]] entered the Tavern, pacified the situaton, and called the Adventurers to a table where he informs the group that the City Guard was in need of some assistance in dealing with a local Goblin Clan stealing from the local residents.  After recruiting the adventuers to the cause, Stron and Haldir departed the tavern as you overhear them discussing what sounds like battle plans and the adventuers followed shortly.
>
> Within the Village market, the party was immediately drawn to [[Quentin Baggybottoms]] who was ecstatic to talk about [[Arcana Wyrm]]s and offered some Healing Kits as a token of appreciation, especially for the inquisitive queries about the mating rituals of the Wyrms.  The adventurers made their way to the Tiselles Gate where they met the brash mason [[Brobouck Hammerchest]], who mentors [[Perrinn Ophinstalajiir]] and reminded Perrinn to run an errand for Ms. Lavern tomorrow.  
> 
> At the Gate entrance, the adventurers met their guide, [[Flynn Thorncoat]] who called the group a "bunch of misfits" under his breath and recieved an axe to the foot in turn. Introductions were made, [[Toothless]] gathered some notes, and and the group set out in the lush wilderness known as the High Forest where they appreciated the beauty of the vast nature surrounding them.  A fox was hunted, suspicious mushrooms were seen, and small talk was made as they made their way east down the well-worn road.
> 
> Several hours in, Flynn led the adventurers off the main path and onto a smaller trail.  It wasn't long before the Scout made a wrong turn, but was quickly corrected by the keen survival instincts of [[Grendyl Silverbuck]].  Before moving on, Grendyl threatened Flynn by throwing a knife between his legs, and Ulfgar body-checked Flynn to the ground.  Flynn brushed it off and led onwards. Before arriving at their destination, the adventurers passed a fallen silk cocoon, the remnant of a Giant Spider's meal and a reminder that they are not alone in this forest.  
> 
> The group finally arrived at the entrance of the Goblin Lair where a patrol of Goblins got the jump on our adventurers in a surprise flurry of arrows. Our protagonists take several arrows to their bodies, a battle ensues, and by the end of it, the clearing was littered with corpses.  A goblin hung from a tree by a spear through the chest, two halves of another lay on the ground.  One in particular looks like it experienced severe emotional trauma as others are slashed, beaten, impaled, and pierced on a field of blood, exploded tree trunks, and body parts.  The Adenturers bonded during their first battle together, surviving with the help of some essential healing magic and [[Elrondhel Grayire|Elrondhel]] even discovered the secret of her bag: drinking the water it holds allows her to fade away from sight and the dangers around her.
>
> After this long batte, our adventurers catch their breath and recover for the moment before journeying further on their mission. Beams of the setting sun breaks through the treetops as the threat of the mystical, wild, and reckless nightlife within the High Forest looms near.
>
> It is here in this brief moment of relaxation that we continue our story...
