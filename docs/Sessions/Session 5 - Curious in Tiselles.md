## Session Recap

As the second day of the party's adventuring came to a close in the Twisted Thicket Tavern, everyone parted ways to head off to sleep.  Elrondhel in the base of a tree to keep watch on the gates, Nokomis and Magy in a room in the inn, Grendyl with his girlfriend [[Naivara Nailo]], and Ulfgar as his residence 2 miles out of town.  Perrinn and Toothless, however, went West to share a smoke in the evening.  On their way they ran into [[Brobouck Hammerchest]] who was initially frustrated with Perry for missing his chores, but became nostalgic after tasting goblin blood. Sacks of stones were dumped onto Perrinn and Toothless as [[Brobouck Hammerchest|Brobouck]] retold the story of loosing his eye to a Goblin's "toothpick" of a sword. 

Brobouck went inside is home while Perrinn and Toothless walked to the water's edge and lit their pipes. As smoke swirled around Perrinn's head, they formed some of his most impressive accomplishments beginning with winning a tic tac toe game against his mom as a young dragonborn and the his first time breathing toxins with his father.  The next memory revealed to Toothless the truth of what happened on the day Perrinn "saved" the mayor; the smoke showed Perrinn took no action, but the mayor ignorantly praised Perrinn as a hero. Finally, the smoke showed one last memory: the lifeless body of Toothless lay on the ground and Dragonborn hands reach out, glow, and breath returns to the corpse once more.

Toothless departed for the evening and Perrinn met Brobouck inside where Brobouck led the Dragonborn to a room never seen before.  Inside held trinkets and adventuring equipment used by Brobouck many years ago.  Brobouck helped the young bard to augment his drum with the ability to create illusions.  Declaring its time to sleep, the Dwarf touched his Lyre, created a powder, threw it into the air, and forced the two of you to fall into a deep slumber.

When you all awoke in the morning, a renewed and newfound strength swelled within you as you gained a level.

Rejoining in the tavern over breakfast and coffee, you decided to split the group to attend to some errands for the day.  Elrondhel, Nokomis, and Toothless made their way to the Mage Tower to seek out clarification on their findings in the depths of the Goblin Lair.  After describing their findings, [[Layla Mooncoat]] was able to determine that the figure was casting Teleportation Circle, a spell that requires a powerful caster.  She was confused that a magic-user of such power was unable to kill off the group of adventurers... unless Axton was stealing the arcane energy of the Arcana Wyrms.  

This thought triggered a memory of an expelled student who attended the Conclave of Silverymoon at the same time as her.  The student, Onazar, was expelled from the school by the [[Conclave Council]] for "illegal experimentation on Awakened Shrubs", but a punishment of that severity was abnormal for a rule so commonly broken at the Conclave.  Rumor has it that the Council felt Onazar's research was a personal threat and dealt with it swiftly.  If indeed, the actions of Axton were related to Onazar's research, then this would certainly be something to be concerned about, as they would be seeking out sources of energy.

Meanwhile, Magy made her way to the Town Records building in search of her Father.  After 6 hours of diligent investigation, Magy found an entry in the Manifest that resembled her own face - a dwarf named [[Silgrul Orothiar]] who arrived in [[Tiselles]] 10 years prior and disappeared 2 years later during a "research trip" to the Northeast.  Along with the entry was something of a trinket left behind.

During these conversations, Ulfgar enters into town, watched by the guards in the gate towers, as he makes his way over to Steely Steals - the Blacksmith's shopfront.  While negotiating the repair of his Greataxe with [[Ium Steelglade]], Ium's crazed Father, [[Ursus Steelglade]] entered the tent and offered to enchant the Greataxe with the power to "whisper".  After agreeing on the transaction, the excitement provoked a mane to burst from Ursus' neck and he explained it was a result of past enchanting mishaps.

Grendyl and Perrinn spent this time to seek clarity in the [[Tiselles Guards|City Watch's]] recent dealings.  To their surprise, they met a formally-dressed and acceptably-groomed [[Haldir Stoutlock|Haldir]] who informed them that [[Stron Oxglove]] was killed during the time the party was in the Goblin Lair while attempting to deal with man-eating plants.  Perrinn offered gold and his condolences, but Haldir respectfully declined.
