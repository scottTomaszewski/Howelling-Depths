## Session Recap

> After taking out two goblin patrols, the adventurers make their way into the Goblin lair, triggering the Goblin's poisonous spear trap and alerting the final sleeping enemies. Waking with the Goblins was an enraged Bugbear, but the battle was quickly ended thanks to some well-placed projectiles and axes. The group found little in the cavern despite their best efforts, until a locked desk drawer proved to be no match for Ulfgar's handaxe where they discovered a clue. After a well deserved rest overnight, the adventurers woke refreshed, discovered a secret door, and activated its magic. Proceeding down the stairs before them, they find another cavern with makeshift furnishings, caged Arcana Wyrms, a glowing circle on the floor, and a hooded figure channeling purple beams of energy into this circle, whose resolve is unwavering despite being grossly outnumbered.
