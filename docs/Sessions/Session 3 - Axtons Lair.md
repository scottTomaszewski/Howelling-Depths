## Session Recap

> As the party descended down into the makeshift dwelling place, illuminated with bright white/purple light, they spoke briefly with the hooded figure who was just finishing some kind of channeling into the light source.  Hearing about his experiments, presumably involving some caged Arcana Wyrms, the group made their strike and quickly wore down Axton, with a final blow splitting his head open.  As he collapsed to the ground, an amulet under his shirt burst with purple light, siphoning the life essence of the cagged wyrms and drawing them back into himself.  His woulds melded back together in an unnatural way as he rose again.  The battle drew on, the the resolve of the party faltered.  Toothless and Nokomis were brought down by the hooded figure, but the quick reactions from Perrinn and Flynn brought them back to consciousness once again.  Finally, Axton's life was taken, now a heap of bloodied flesh.  The party explored the lair to discover some of Axton's personal effects: clothes, a few decorated pipes, and a kit for personalizing a drum.  Taking a closer look where the purple light source once was, you piece together that Axton was using the chalks, inks, and diamond dust for spell components, but they have all but been consumed by his casting.  As to what this incantation was, nobody seemed to recognize it, but it must be related to the crates of industrial equipment and arcane apparatuses found nearby.  Before departing for the cave entrance, Nokomis with the help of the clever tongue of Elrondhel was able to lure out a baby Arcana Wyrm who was able to escape Axton's Siphoning. Attracted to Nokomis' lunar connection, the wyrm took comfort in the elf's prescence, led her to a small trinket the wyrm found of interest, and they all started making their way out. Before departing, curiosity got the better of Ulfgar as he smashed his greataxe into the runes on the floor, leaving the stone unphased, but his weapon's blade shattered.
