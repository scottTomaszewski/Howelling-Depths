## Session Recap

Last we left off, you all took a short break to recover and examine some newly found trinkets.  Nokomis' needle was discovered to be a magical tattoo that seems to satiate and nourish her (*yet to be named*) Arcana Wyrm.  Grendyl came to find his pouch was reversible, one side for creating ingredients, the other for creating a variety of adorable creatures.  Perrinn also sought to remember the victory over the Goblin Lair by asking his allies to sign his drum.

Making your way back to your starting village of [[Tiselles]], Elrondhel took a moment to speak with a nearby bird to verify that the stolen goods requested by [[Stron Oxglove|Stron]] were indeed only taken by Goblins, and Perrinn started his rock collection. 

When you arrived at the Tiselles Gates, [[Flynn Thorncoat|Flynn]] abruptly halted the excited approach of his sons while whistling for his fellow guards in order to make known that there are **always** consequences to your actions.  But... he let you off for now...

You all made your way to the Tiselles barracks in search for the Captain of the Guard, [[Stron Oxglove]], but he was not to be found. Instead, you were attended to by a seemingly overwhelmed and disheveled [[Haldir Stoutlock]].  Perrinn took advantage of the distracted lieutenant and convinced him their payment was 25% higher than originally agreed.  

Additionally, [[Haldir Stoutlock|Haldir]] pointed you all in the direction of the Mage Tower to dig into Axton's arcane ritual and his "experiments".

Curious at [[Haldir Stoutlock|Haldir]]'s unnatural behavior, Elrondhel drank from her waterskin, faded away from those around her, and attempted to sneak through the doorway to get a closer look at the interior. [[Haldir Stoutlock|Haldir]] noticed her presence and kicked her out the doorway, but not before she got a glimpse of fresh leaves and grass along the floor and a glint of metal on the table surrounded by guards.

On your way to regroup in the tavern over a nice pint, Magy was confronted by [[Wentworth Webster]], the Town Records Keeper, and after informing him that his rare inks were lost, he agreed to assist you in your search of the records during business hours.

You all made your way into the tavern, ordered some dinner and drinks, and that is where we will pick up this session.
