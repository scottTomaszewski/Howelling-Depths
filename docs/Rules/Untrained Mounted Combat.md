# Untrained Mounted Combat

## Mounting a Untrained Mount

Once during your move, you can attempt to mount a creature that is within 5 feet of you or dismount. If the Mount is Untrained, doing so requires success on a `DC 13 Animal Handling` check and costs an amount of movement equal to half your speed.

## Controlling an Untrained Mount

At the beginning of every turn you start mounted on an Untrained Mount, you must make a `Animal Handling` skill check with the following potential outcomes

| Roll | Outcome                                                                                             |
| ---- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 13+  | As a **Bonus Action**, the rider can move the Mount up to it's movement speed                       |
| 6-12 | Mount moves in a way that is natural for the situation (attacks or flees from threats, grazes, etc) |
| 0-5  | Mount attempts to buck off the rider, make a contested Strength check to remain mounted. If the rider fails, they are Unseated              |

Only movement is possible with an Untrained Mount and the rider is unable to command the Mount to take any actions.

## Unseating a Rider

Riders are knocked off a mount if some effect separates them, such as a successful shove. Additionally a rider that is knocked prone is also knocked off their mount. If an effect moves a mount against its will, any rider must make a `Dexterity (Animal Handling)` check either at the DC for the effect that moved the mount or `10`, whichever is higher.

A rider knocked off a mount takes falls prone in a logical spot next to the mount. Additionally they may suffer other appropriate effects depending on the circumstance, such as falling off a tall or flying mount. In addition to any other effects, a rider knocked off a moving mount makes a `DC 12 Dexterity Saving Throw`. On a failed save they take `1d6` damage, or `2d6` if the mount was dashing, or `half` as much on a successful save.
