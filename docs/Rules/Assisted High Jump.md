# Assisted High Jump

### Homebrew (BETA)

A PC (Assister) can boost another PC (Jumper) with a running start to gain additional height according to the following

PC (Jumper) can jump `3 + Jumper STR Modifier + (0.5 * Assister's height) + Assister STR Modifier + Assister Athletics Proficiency`

> Example: Jumper (Grendyl) with STR Modifier of `+1` and Assister (Ulfgar) with STR Modifier of `+4` and height of `4 feet` would calculate as
> `3 + 1 + (0.5 * 4) + 4 + 2` = `12 feet`

When performing, both the Assister and the Jumper need to make `DC 15` `Dexterity (Acrobatics)` checks to attempt this.

- If the Assister fails, he/she immediately falls prone
- If the Jumper fails, he/she stumbles and only jumps half as high

#### [Jumping](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/The%20Environment#h-Jumping)

Your [Strength](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Ability%20Scores#h-Strength) determines how far you can jump.  
  
**Long [Jump](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Jump#h-Jump)**. When you make a [Long Jump](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Your%20Turn#h-Long%20Jump), you cover a number of feet up to your [Strength](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Ability%20Scores#h-Strength) score if you move at least 10 feet on foot immediately before the jump. When you make a standing [Long Jump](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Your%20Turn#h-Long%20Jump), you can leap only half that distance. Either way, each foot you clear on the jump costs a foot of [Movement](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Your%20Turn#h-Movement).  
  
This rule assumes that the height of your jump doesn’t matter, such as a jump across a stream or chasm. At your GM’s option, you must succeed on a DC 10 [Strength](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Ability%20Scores#h-Strength) (Athletics) check to clear a low obstacle (no taller than a quarter of the jump’s distance), such as a hedge or low wall. Otherwise, you hit it.  
  
When you land in [Difficult Terrain](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Combat#h-Difficult%20Terrain), you must succeed on a DC 10 [Dexterity](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Ability%20Scores#h-Dexterity) (Acrobatics) check to land on your feet. Otherwise, you land prone.  
  
**High [Jump](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Jump#h-Jump)**. When you make a [High Jump](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Your%20Turn#h-High%20Jump), you leap into the air a number of feet equal to 3 + your [Strength](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Ability%20Scores#h-Strength) modifier if you move at least 10 feet on foot immediately before the jump. When you make a standing [High Jump](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Your%20Turn#h-High%20Jump), you can jump only half that distance. Either way, each foot you clear on the jump costs a foot of [Movement](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Your%20Turn#h-Movement). In some circumstances, your GM might allow you to make a [Strength](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Ability%20Scores#h-Strength) (Athletics) check to jump higher than you normally can.  
  
You can extend your arms half your height above yourself during the jump. Thus, you can reach above you a distance equal to the height of the jump plus 1½ times your height.
